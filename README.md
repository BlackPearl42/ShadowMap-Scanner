# ShadowMap Web : Advanced Reconnaissance Tool


## âœ¨ Features

* **HTTP/HTTPS Header Analysis:** Detailed examination of server responses, including content types, caching, and custom headers.
* **Security Header Checks:** Identifies missing or misconfigured security headers like Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options.
* **WAF/CDN Detection:** Automatically detects Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare.
* **IP & Direct Connection Testing:** Resolves the target IP and attempts direct connections for potential WAF bypass strategies.
* **Intelligent Nmap Suggestions:** Provides Nmap scanning recommendations based on WAF detection and direct IP connectivity.
* **`robots.txt` Deep Analysis:** Fetches, parses, and tests `Disallow` directives in `robots.txt` for accessible sensitive paths.
* **Sensitive File & Directory Scanning:** Scans for common sensitive files (e.g., `.git/HEAD`, `backup.zip`, `sitemap.xml`) and directories (e.g., `/admin`, `/login`).
* **Page Content Analysis:** Extracts snippets of `README.md` content and identifies potential injection points in forms.
* **Subdomain Enumeration:** Discovers subdomains related to the target domain.
* **Customizable Scans:** Supports custom wordlists for sensitive path and subdomain enumeration, along with adjustable timeouts and delays.
* **User-Friendly Output:** Utilizes `colorama` for clear, color-coded output, making results easy to read and understand.
* **Optimized for Stealth & Speed:** Designed to minimize noise and rapidly gather information, enhancing evasion against common detection mechanisms
